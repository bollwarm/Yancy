    [Fixed]

    - Raised minimum Mojolicious version to 7.15 (which adds
      Mojo::File). Thanks CPAN Testers!

0.002     2017-12-02 20:46:56-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed app trying to save readonly properties. The OpenAPI spec
      prevents this, but that means we get an error and our data isn't
      saved correctly.

    - Fixed invalid spec URL. The spec only worked accidentally, which
      was weird...

    [Added]

    - Added screenshot to documentation
