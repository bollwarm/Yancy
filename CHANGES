Changelog for Yancy

{{ $NEXT }}

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed app trying to save readonly properties. The OpenAPI spec
      prevents this, but that means we get an error and our data isn't
      saved correctly.

    - Fixed invalid spec URL. The spec only worked accidentally, which
      was weird...

    [Added]

    - Added screenshot to documentation
